    Given centers and widths, you first have to get an array of 0/1, with 1s

    the 0/1 array. The final output will sum the "activations" of all tilings.
    We recommend to normalize the output in [0, 1] by dividing by the number of
    tilings (offsets).
    Recall that tiles are squares, so you can't use the L2 Euclidean distance to
    check if a state belongs to a tile, but the L1 distance.

# - Use all 5 FAs implemented above and submit your plots. Select the

#   allows to pass different widths/sigmas for every dimension of the state.
#   How would you change the hyperparameters? Would you have more centers?
#   Or wider sigmas/widths? Both? Justify your answer in one sentence.

# Note: we don't want you to achieve MSE 0. Just have a decent plot with each FA,
